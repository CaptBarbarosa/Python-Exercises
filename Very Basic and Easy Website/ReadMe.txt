Python 3.9.13 is used for this assignment

We used windows operating system while completing the assignment.

We met and finished the assignment together on the library. This assignment was mainly written by Eren's hands but both of us used our full thinking and problem solving capabilities. When Eren stuck somewhere, kaan gave an idea to solve the issue and when there were no problem, Eren wrote the code. We had some hard time creating front-end but the lecture materials provided us with the necessary information.
