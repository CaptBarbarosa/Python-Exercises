Python 3.9.13 is used for this assignment

We used windows operating system while completing the assignment.

We met and finished the assignment together on the dormitories. It was Kaan's hands but both of our brains. When Kaan stuck somewhere, Eren gave an idea and when there were no problem, Kaan wrote the code. We had some issues at the dictionaries and we worked out the problem thanks to the lecture materials.
